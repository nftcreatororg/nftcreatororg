"When the NFT CREATORS came, they promised nothing, and asked for nothing in return. They merely showed us a way the world could be, and invited us to manifest it into being. With hearts full of hope, we stepped into the void.”
<NFT Creators launched as a fixed set of 10,000 items in mid-2021 and became one of the inspirations for the ERC-721 standard. They have been featured in places like The New York Times, Christie’s of London, Art|Basel Miami, and The PBS NewsHour.
nftcreatororg/nftcreatororg is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its The NFTcreator Club is a collection of 10,000 unique unique NFTs— unique digital collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain. Your NFT Creator doubles as your NFT creator Club membership card, and grants access to members-only benefits, the first of which is access to THE BATHROOM, a collaborative graffiti board. Future areas and perks can be unlocked by the community through roadmap activation. 
--->a nod to the luck associated with the number in the web3 world.
